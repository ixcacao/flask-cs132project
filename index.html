						<p>
							In response to Duterte’s statement, economist and professor Emmanel Leyco expressed the potential difficulties if ever Mindanao plans to secede. He asserted the capability of the island region with its substantial agricultural resources, but mentioned its present underdeveloped state that would hamper its aspiration to progress as a separate entity <a href="https://news.tv5.com.ph/local/read/not-helpful-economist-sees-economic-disaster-if-mindanao-secession-pushes-through">[1]</a>.

							In Southeast Asia, Singapore was the first to lead the

							  sentiments triggered this movement 
							  <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642221?seq=1">[3]</a>. The separation was a success, and Singapore has since become a developed country with a strong economy. From a general standpoint, Singapore has significantly less land mass than Mindanao, but a lower unemployment rate and higher GDP. However, due to its small agricultural production, it highly relies on imports to sustain its demand for food <a href="https://www.rbcrca.com.sg/singapore-vs-other-countries/comparing-singapore-and-the-philippines">[4]</a>. Mindanao, on the other hand, is a region whose economy is dominated by the agricultural sector. One-third of its area is dedicated to agriculture, and the island produces 40% of the country’s total food requirements <a href="https://www.aesanetwork.org/development-of-halal-agricultural-production-systems-in-mindanao-philippines/">[5]</a>.

					<li>Alpha (significance level): 0.01</li>
					</p>
					
					<p>P-values for each correlation pair (agricultural industry input to industry i to industry i output), from the Pearson correlation test, were combined using <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.combine_pvalues.html"><strong>Fisher’s method</strong></a>.</p>
					The resulting p-value for the Philippines dataset is <strong>3.2171407277283736e-40</strong>, which is lower than the significance level (0.01).

				<h2>Discussion</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="glass-container horizontal-center left-align">
				<p>As there is a relationship between the input from the agricultural sector and the output of an industry, it is essential to note the potential ripple effects it could have when a policy to increase agricultural output is issued. Consequently, any environmental or economic event that risks the production of the agricultural industry may also affect industries that rely on or correlate with agricultural output. </p>
				
				<p>Paired with this, it is also important to note that if the agricultural output is increased, if it is not inputted to the other industries, it does not translate into a ripple effect to the other industries.
				</p>

				<p>Even with high correlation values overall, it is evident that there are industries in a specific country that show weak correlation to agriculture input but show substantial correlation in other countries. For instance, the outputs of coke, refined petroleum, and nuclear fuel along with the rubber and plastics industries exhibit a very weak correlation to the agriculture input in the Philippines, yet have a high correlation in other southeast asian countries. Aside from this, there are industries that show positive correlation in the majority of the countries but are negatively correlated in one. That is, apart from the mining, food, and paper product industries, other industries' relationship with agriculture, between SEA countries, has no definite shape - which might imply the varied behavior of their economies.</p>

				<p>Nonetheless, because of the strong correlation found between input from the agricultural industry and industry output in Mindanao (in fact even higher than that of the whole country), there is merit in considering the point raised in the news report. However, further research is needed to determine how much the market of the potentially separate Mindanao would depend on the agriculture industry, as well as if this is sustainable.</p>

				
			</div>
			<div class="top-margin glass-container horizontal-center left-align">
				<div>
					<h4>Machine Learning</h4>
				</div>

				<p>In an attempt to generalize the trend of the growth in each country, we created and tested models that can predict the future Input-Output Tables of the different countries in this study. </p>

				<p>Given that there are categorical variables that are essential to the prediction (Country and Source Industry), we incorporated dummy variables to represent these variables in the linear regression model. Our references for the variables are the Philippines and the Agriculture industry respectively. After organizing the information, fitting the model with the different combinations of features as documented in our methods <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wxxtye1hP_JJi-eo4gAZjhGuAcQp74QR#scrollTo=5gwgT9Y02BCR">here</a>, and testing the models, we cross-checked to see the error of the different models in predicting the Input-Output tables of the different countries. This leads us to discover that the error (using mean squared error) is relatively large (around 700 to 850 in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam, around 1,500 in Thailand, and around 2,300 in Indonesia) given the range of the values in the model (0 to 10,000). 
				</p>

				<p>On average, the 2 most accurate models are the ones that have the {Industries, Country, Output by Industry} and {Industries, Country, Output by Industry, Year} as the features, with the latter being more accurate overall. This could be because of the link between the Industry Output and their respective Input-Output tables as the inputs to the other industries and exports are capped at the total output of the source industry. Although this is the case, the relatively large error is still of note and maybe a point of further research. Another thing of note is the larger error when predicting the IO table for Indonesia. This could signify that the economic structure of Indonesia is a potential outlier in the SEA context as can also be inferred in the correlation heatmaps. Thailand is also of note, but not so much as Indonesia.</p>

					<p>Perform methods that best describe the flow between sectors such as network analysis and measures of centrality like closeness or betweenness to effectively compare industry behaviors of each country.
